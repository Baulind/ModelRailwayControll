Django vs Flask. 
Flsak is not used often in the industry. Not as powerfull as Django. 
But Django cannot apply for the API. Building a small website, flask is perfect. 
Way more simple and faster. 

Package install: 
-       pip install flask 
-       pip install flask-login
-       pip install flask-sqlalchemy


1. Initiate the app, and create app function (SECRET HEY MUST BE CHANGED)

2. Make sure that the python interpretor is not wrong, if the issue "flask module is not found" do this: 
(Its common in VsCode)
 Ctrl + Shift + P
  -> python: Select interpreter
  -> Select the conda one. 


Make routs in views.py and auth.py 
Register them in __init__.py

Go in templates and make som HTML files 
In static we want to save img, javascript or CSS

How we use the base template: 
1. Make a home tamplete .html
2. in home.html = {% extends "base.html" %} {% block title %}Changed{% endblock %}
3. Go to views.py, and render the template 

Endblock formating (if in templates) : 45:00

Using HTTP while submiting the button while reg ot login 
What type of request do you want to send to the website 
GET -> Loading the website (retriving informations)
POST -> Some kind of change of the state 

Save users info in a database using POST 

After that go to __init__ and start on the database
For now gonna use Flask sqlalchemy, but afterwards we can change it to postressql 

Wanna make two databases, one for the users, one for the nodes
